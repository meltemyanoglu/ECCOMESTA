% Nonfunctional requirements: what other characteristics should the system have, besides functional requirements?



The system should; 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Respond in acceptable time for user queries or transactions, 
    \item Store all the data and metadata related to each login session of each person and all the connected information, 
    \item Work with other software systems and databases through standardized interfaces and protocols, 
    \item Internationalization to allow customers speaking various languages to utilize the system, 
    \item Have different user permissions for different roles; for example the employees of a store see other stores' stocks but cannot make any change of it, 
    \item Documented periodically and clearly and be up-to-date,
    \item Periodic backup of contents to avoid loss of data in case of malfunction and loss of database contents, 

\end{itemize}
