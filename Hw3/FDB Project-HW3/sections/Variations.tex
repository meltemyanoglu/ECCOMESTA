\section{Variations to the Relational Schema}
%\textcolor{red}{[Describe here variations and/or corrections to the relational schema of the previous homework, if present. Otherwise, report only the relational schema.]}

The Figure 1 shows the relational schema after some changes made due to the feedback received in the correction of the second homework.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We create a new relationship between Receipt and Employee, called \textbf{Emitted-By}, a one-to-many relationship created to praise the importance of Employee.
    \item We changed the cardinality of the relation between \textit{Product} and \textit{Supplier}, from a one-to-many to a many-to-many.
    \item We changed the relationship\textbf{ Supplies-to}, a binary relationship between \textit{Product} and \textit{Supplier}, to \textbf{Supplies}, a ternary relationship between \textit{Supplier}, \textit{Product} and \textit{Store}, with the attribute Quantity, that indicated the amount of product supplied by a supplier to a specific store.
    \item We deleted the attribute \textit{orderquantity} of the relationship Stores, because now this information in the \textit{Supplies} relationship's attribute, \textbf{quantity}.

\end{itemize}
